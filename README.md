# employe_attrition
Cleaned the data by removing any empty rows and columns to make sure everything was accurate.
Created a correlation matrix to find the most important factors that could cause an employee to leave.
Split the data into 80% for training the model and 20% for testing, marking 1 if the employee is likely to leave and 0 if they are likely to stay.
Built two models, one using linear regression and the other using decision trees, to predict if an employee will leave.
Combined the results from both models and used the higher prediction value to decide if the employee will leave or stay.
